# *The Classroom vs. The Work World*

#### Forget everything you know (kind of)

^ Forget everything you think you know (well, not exactly)

---

## Classroom: 

### The *process* is dictated

---

## Work World:

### The *result* is dictated

^ You figure out how to get there.

---

## Classroom: 

### The *design* is the deliverable

---

## Work World:

### The *finished product* is the deliverable

---

## Classroom: 

### Build something *new* (or redesign something)

---

## Work World:

### *Add features* to an existing product

---

## Classroom: 

### Come up with the *best user experience* possible.

---

## Work World:

### *Make money* for the company.

## *Dear American Airlines...*

---

"Recently I had the horrific displeasure of booking a flight on your website...

"Fire your entire design team, if you have one. Hire an outside design firm ... as quickly as possible. Your in-house team is obviously incapable of building a good experience."

## *Dear Dustin Curtis...*

---

"The group running AA.com consists of at least *200 people* spread out amongst many different groups, [each] with their own vested interests... 

"Simply doing a home page redesign is a piece of cake... *doing the design isn’t the hard part*, and I think that’s what a lot of outsiders don’t really get."

^ The problem with the design of AA.com lies more with the culture and processes employed here at American Airlines...

^ The moral of the story is that Success = Design + Delivery.

# *Soft Skills for UX Designers*

^ What gets you the job has little relation to what makes you good at it.

---

# Build Relationships

^ and learn what matters to the other people on your team. Build up some capital. 

---

# Negotiation and Compromise

^ Be prepared for some wins and losses, some give and take. Be willing to accept compromise.
